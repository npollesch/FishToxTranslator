Description: The Fish Toxicity Translator is used to estimate the population-level impacts of exposure to chemical and non-chemical stressors.  Starting with a baseline fish population, stressor scenarios are developed and their impacts are interpreted as a change from baseline population levels and dynamics.
    The underlying model is a size-structured integral projection model.  The model has a daily time-step and is run for year-long simulations.  Each day has it's own 'transition kernel' that estimates the impact of that day's circumstances on the population. Results can be analyzed at the daily and yearly level.
    This tool has been developed by the USEPA to interpret population impacts of exposure based on laboratory effects data paired with exposure data.  Model outputs include population levels (# of individuals), daily and yearly population growth potential, and insights into population size-structure.
